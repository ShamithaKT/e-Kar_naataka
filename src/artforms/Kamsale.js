          <h2><strong>Evolution</strong> </h2>
          <p> Kamsale artists have no printed literature. They learn those songs orally. They participate in fairs, which are held in Mahadeshwara hills during Diwali, Shivaratri and Ugadi festivals.
            The singing artists wear a special dress. The artists, with the Kamsale in the left hand, expose it to be hit by the Kamsale held in the right hand. Thus rhythm is created of various patterns and tempos. Beesu Kamsale or Kamsale dance is a unique dance form in which religious fervour combines with martial dexterity. The instruments, in the course of the vigorous rhythmic beatings are moved around the body of the dancer in innumerable patterns manifesting both skill and art. The main element in art is the rhythmic clang, which blends with the melodious music of the Mahadeshwara epic. In a group movement the dancer provides the vision of a series of offensive and defensive manoeuvers, which is a testimony to the Kuruba people being of Martial stock.</p>
