          <h1><strong>BARATHNATYA</strong></h1>
          <p>Bharatanatyam (Tamil: பரதநாட்டியம்) is an Indian classical dance form that originated in Tamil Nadu. It is one of eight Indian classical dance forms recognized by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, and expresses South Indian religious themes and spiritual ideas, particularly of Shaivism and in general of Hinduism.</p>
          <p>Bharatanatyam contains different types of banis. Bani, or "tradition", is a term used to describe the dance technique and style specific to a guru or school, often named for the village of the guru. Bharatanatyam style is noted for its fixed upper torso, bent legs and knees flexed (Araimandi) combined with footwork, and a vocabulary of sign language based on gestures of hands, eyes, and face muscles</p>

          <h2><strong>HISTORY</strong></h2>
          <p>The theoretical foundations of Bharatanatyam are found first in Kootha Nool in Tamil and then referred also in Natya Shastra, a Sanskrit text of performance arts.

            Natya Shastra is attributed to the ancient scholar Bharata Muni, and its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE. The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters. The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures—all of which are part of Indian classical dances. Dance and performance arts, states this text, are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues and the essence of scriptures</p>

          <p><strong>Namaskar/Namaskaram</strong>
            Namaskar, also referred to as Namaskaram, is the proper way of offering prayer and gratitude to those who allow the dancer to continue her Bharatanatyam education, Dancers perform the prayer before and after a session of dancing in order to practice gratitude and develop their spiritual growth. The prayer first thanks God (Nataraja), then the Guru (teacher) and parents, and finally the audience who offer their time to watch the dancer perform.</p>
          <p><strong>Adavus</strong>
            The word Adavu comes from the Tamil root adu, meaning to dance. The Adavus are sets of basic dance steps which help a dancer master the foundation. Adavus will also refine a dancer's endurance, posture, mudras, dhristi bheda (eye movements), etc.
