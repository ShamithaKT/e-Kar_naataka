          <h2> <strong>History</strong></h2>
          <p>Typically, young males form troops of five to ten members or more, which will have three to five males painted and costumed to look like tigers, and a band called thaase in Tulu with two or three drummers. This troop is accompanied by the manager of the group. During Navratri, these troops will be roaming the streets of their towns, with the accompanying drum beats of their bands. They stop at homes and businesses or on the roadsides to perform for about ten minutes after which they collect some money from the people who have observed their performance.

            The troops perform until the last day of Navratri, and almost all of them form part of the Sharada processions organized by various temples such as Mangaladevi, Gokarnanatheshwara and Venkatramana temple. After the procession is over, performances are stopped and the paint is removed.</p>

          <h2><strong>Evolution</strong> </h2>
          <p>  Pilivesha Mask
            While Pili means "tiger" in Tulu, dancers also painted themselves with leopard or cheetah motifs. The costumes may vary depending on the place, costumes used in Mangalore is different compared to Udupi district. Each person will be wearing just a knicker/shorts, which usually has a tiger-skin motif. The rest of his bare body and face is painted with various designs that denote tigers, cheetahs, and leopards. A headgear or mask made of fake fur and sometimes a tail is worn to complete the ensemble.
            
            The paint causes a burning sensation on the skin. But this is endured by the persons to be part of the celebrations and also to earn some extra money in the holiday season. Originally people used to do this as a part of a religious vow. The paint is kept on the body for a couple of days and repainted or retouched as desired.The skills may vary from person to person and the basic skill required is to know the tiger dance steps which requires one to have enough stamina. Usual skills performed by the artists are Fire breathing, Hand walking, Handstands, gymnastic moves, picking money from mouth by bending backwards and lifting akkimudi (rice tied in straw, weighing 42 kg!) in their teeth and throwing it backwards etc.Pili vesha which means dressing up like tigers of pilinalike which means Tiger dance practiced in Tulunad. This dance form is an ode to goddess Durga and her vahana, the tiger. Men, who have vowed to play the pili vesha on fulfillment of their prayers take to dressing up like tigers and dancing in teams, going door to door for nine days. These team dances on the courtyards of the houses and collect the money offered to them in return. It is truly wonderful to witness the tiger dance. To speak about origin of ‘Pili Vesha’ or ‘Pili Nalike’ had started in the land of Mangalore(Kudla) itself. As per the belief, a couple who had a disabled child had vowed to goddess Mangaladevi seeking her benevolence. They had to dress the child like tiger and let him for collecting alms for nine days of Navaratri and within the completion of Navaratri days the child’s disability was reversed. It was believed that due to power of goddess Mangaladevi the boy cured his disability and hence the tradition is continued.</p>
