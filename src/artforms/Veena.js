          <h1 className="my-3">SARASWATI<strong>VEENA</strong></h1>
          <p>Saraswati veena is an ancient Indian plucked veena. It is named after the Hindu goddess Saraswati, who is usually depicted holding or playing the instrument. Also known as raghunatha veena, it is used mostly in Carnatic Indian classical music. There are several variations of the veena, which in its South Indian form is a member of the lute family. One who plays the veena is referred to as a vaiṇika.</p>
        <p>The Saraswati veena is one of major types of veena today. The others include chitra veena, vichitra veena and rudra veena. Out of these the rudra and vichitra veenas are used more often in Hindustani music, while the Saraswati veena and the chitra veena are used more frequently in the Carnatic music of South India. They can be used to play either traditional music or contemporary music.</p>

          <h2><strong>HISTORY</strong></h2>
          <p>The veena instruments developed much like a tree, branching out into instruments as diverse as the harp-like Akasa (a veena that was tied up in the tops of trees for the strings to vibrate from the currents of wind) and the Audumbari veena (played as an accompaniment by the wives of Vedic priests as they chanted during ceremonial Yajnas). Veenas ranged from one string to one hundred and were composed of many different materials like eagle bone, bamboo, wood, and coconut shells. The yazh was an ancient harp-like instrument that was also considered a veena. But with the developments of the fretted veena instruments, the yazh quickly faded away, as the fretted veena allowed for the easy performance of ragas and the myriad subtle nuances and pitch oscillations in the gamakas prevalent in the Indian musical system.[2] As is seen in many Hindu temple sculptures and paintings, the early veenas were played vertically. It was not until the great Indian Carnatic music composer and Saraswati veena player Muthuswami Dikshitar that it began to be popularized as played horizontally.</p>

          <h2 className="my-1">PLAYING<strong> TECHNIQUES</strong></h2>
          <p>The small gourd of veena on the left rests on the player's left thigh, the left arm passing beneath the neck with the hand curving up and around so that the fingers rest upon the frets. The palm of the right hand rests on the edge of the top plank so that the fingers can pluck the strings. The drone strings are played with the little finger. The veena's large resonator is placed on the floor, beyond the right thigh.
           Like the sitar, the left hand technique involves playing on the frets,controlled pushing on the strings to achieve higher tones and glissandi through increased tension, and finger flicks, all reflecting the characteristics of various ragas and their ornamentation. Modern innovations include one or two circular sound holes, substitution of machine heads for wooden pegs for easier tuning, and the widespread use of transducers for amplification in performance

          <h2>DO YOU<strong> KNOW</strong></h2>
         <p>The Ramayana, the Bhagavata, the Puranas, and Bharat Muni's Natya Shastra all contain references to the veenas, scriptures, and aranyaka. The Vedic sage Yajnavalkya speaks of the greatness of the veenas in these verses: "One who is skilled in playing the veena, one who is familiar with the types of surutis (quarter notes), and one who is skilled in the tala (rhythm), , Veena is mentioned in many ancient Sanskrit and Tamil texts, such as Lalita Sahasranama, Adi Shankara's Soundarya Lahari, and the poet Kalidasa's Sanskrit epic Kumarasambhava, to name a few. and Shamala Dandakam, Tamil Tevaram and Thiruvasagam, such as Meenakshi Pancharatnam's 'veena venu mridanga vAdhya rasikAm' and Appar's 'mAsil veeNaiyum mAlai madhiyumum' Thevaram. there is. The veenas, or the Hindu goddesses who play the veena, namely Saraswati and Shakti, are also called kachapi or vipanchis in Sanskrit texts. Songs such as Thiyagaraja's "Mokshamgarada" contain a philosophy on the spiritual aspect of the veena, each physical part of the veena being a seat for the subtle aspects of various gods and goddesses in Hinduism. It is said that. The neck of the instrument is Lord Shiva. The strings make up his consort, Parvati. The bridge is Lakshmi, the second gourd is Brahma, and the dragon head is Vishnu. Above the "table" is Saraswati. "Therefore, the veena is the abode of divinity and the source of all happiness." - R. Rangaramanuja Ayangar The eminent veena player E. Gayathri has stated in many interviews that the Aitareya Upanishads have the human being " It states that there is a passage stating that it is a veena. Created by God, the Saraswati veena is a man-made form. According to her, the veena is reminiscent of the human skeleton, the resonating kudam represents the skull, the dandies and lions face the human spine, and her 24 frets on the fingerboard are clearly human. It represents her 24 vertebrae. human spine</p>
